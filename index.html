      There's some evidence to suggest that when you make the reading experience too smooth and glossy and beautiful, you make it less engaging and satisfying, too. The key concept here, explored in depth by the psychologist Adam Alter, author of the book Drunk Tank Pink, is "cognitive disfluency". When information glides by too frictionlessly, we're liable to find it harder both to understand and to retain.

      In a classic experiment, students were presented with a printed question: how many of each animal did Moses take into the ark? When the question was displayed in an easy-to-read typeface, 88% missed the error – that the gentleman in question was Noah, not Moses. When it was displayed in a hard-to-read font, that proportion fell to 53%. When a font's harder to read, writes Alter, "we assume the task is difficult and requires additional mental effort … We respond by recruiting additional mental resources to overcome that challenge, and our responses tend to be more accurate." Other studies have found that information received in unfamiliar fonts is memorised more effectively, and that it may be harder to grasp material consumed in e-book form, where the words slide by as if on ice skates, than in print.

      By contrast, there's an unbearable lightness to the slippery minimalism of Medium, and sometimes it gets in the way. Writing presented like that is wonderfully easy to consume, yet also wonderfully easy to forget. By the time I get to the end of even a short piece, the first paragraph has faded not just from the screen, but from my mind.

        In 1981, two psychologists documented a now famous illusion when they asked students a simple question: "how many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark?" Eighty-one per cent of the students answered with "two". It wasn't until later that 96 per cent of them correctly added that the animals actually joined Noah -- not Moses -- on the Ark.

        it suggests that people have limited processing capacity and they're more likely to take a new idea on board when the idea is uncomplicated, accessible and memorable. Unfortunately, since simpler messages are less likely to challenge us, we're also more likely to overlook them.

      <br><br>

        Researchers have shown, then, that small bursts of mental complexity -- also known as cognitive disfluency -- encourage us to think more clearly. In one demonstration, psychologists found that students fell for the Moses Illusion 88 per cent of the time when the question was presented in an easy-to-read typeface, whereas only 53 per cent of the students in a second sample committed the error when the question was printed in a harder-to-read, grey Brush Script typeface.

        Web design isn’t all about what designers like—hey, not every website needs touches of buttercup yellow and aqua! It’s about what visitors want and what will best achieve the client’s goals. There are lots of ways for designers to embrace their creativity and make beautiful, functional websites. The first step is to understand how the mind works, and how that applies to your buyer personas.

          when it comes to dis-fluent designs, anything that makes visual perception less automatic – an unexpected layout, unusual colors, or a low figure-ground contrast – will originate more cognitive reflection. What can be the consequences of making material harder to read and people to reflect more about what they read?

        ugliness seems to have its advantages. Presenting information in a lower, less familiar, and less saturated color font, might slow down the reader's brain, allow the reader to engage with the material at a deeper level, and improve information comprehension and retention.

        The digital world, and to a greater extent the offline world, tend to think that high levels of fluency are always better: The easier and the faster, the better. However, the psychological literature suggests that sometimes hard can be better, especially if we want to make people to think more carefully about what is on the screen or even on paper.
