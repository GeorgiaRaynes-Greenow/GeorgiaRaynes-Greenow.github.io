    <div class="paragraph">

      There's some evidence to suggest that when you make the reading experience too smooth and glossy and beautiful, you make it less engaging and satisfying, too. The key concept here, explored in depth by the psychologist Adam Alter, author of the book Drunk Tank Pink, is "cognitive disfluency". When information glides by too frictionlessly, we're liable to find it harder both to understand and to retain.

    In a classic experiment, students were presented with a printed question: how many of each animal did Moses take into the ark? When the question was displayed in an easy-to-read typeface, 88% missed the error – that the gentleman in question was Noah, not Moses. When it was displayed in a hard-to-read font, that proportion fell to 53%. When a font's harder to read, writes Alter, "we assume the task is difficult and requires additional mental effort … We respond by recruiting additional mental resources to overcome that challenge, and our responses tend to be more accurate." Other studies have found that information received in unfamiliar fonts is memorised more effectively, and that it may be harder to grasp material consumed in e-book form, where the words slide by as if on ice skates, than in print.

    By contrast, there's an unbearable lightness to the slippery minimalism of Medium, and sometimes it gets in the way. Writing presented like that is wonderfully easy to consume, yet also wonderfully easy to forget. By the time I get to the end of even a short piece, the first paragraph has faded not just from the screen, but from my mind.

      <div class="paragraph">

        Simply put, cognitive fluency describes how easy it is to think about something. Our minds naturally favor things that are easy to process, so anything that takes extra mental effort gets flagged as undesirable.

      <div class="paragraph">

      Cognitive fluency is also a big part of why people tend to prefer things that are visually simple. We see complicated websites as being less beautiful because the more our eyes and brains have to take in, the harder they have to work to decode, store, and process that information.

      <div class="paragraph">

      There are many things a designer can do to subtly disrupt the cognitive fluency of a site, causing the viewer’s mind to stop and analyze the situation. Some of these elements are the style and size of fonts, the color and size of calls-to-action, and the appearance of depth or texture.

    <div class="paragraph">

      Web design isn’t all about what designers like—hey, not every website needs touches of buttercup yellow and aqua! It’s about what visitors want and what will best achieve the client’s goals. There are lots of ways for designers to embrace their creativity and make beautiful, functional websites. The first step is to understand how the mind works, and how that applies to your buyer personas.
